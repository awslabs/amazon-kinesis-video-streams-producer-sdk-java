## Introduction

Amazon Kinesis Video Streams makes it easy to securely stream video from connected devices to AWS for analytics, machine learning (ML), and other processing.

The Amazon Kinesis Video Streams Producer SDK Java makes it easy to build an on-device application that securely connects to a video stream, and reliably publishes video and other media data to Kinesis Video Streams. It takes care of all the underlying tasks required to package the frames and fragments generated by the device's media pipeline. The SDK also handles stream creation, token rotation for secure and uninterrupted streaming, processing acknowledgements returned by Kinesis Video Streams, and other tasks.

### Prerequisites

* You can find available pre-built KinesisVideoProducerJNI library in [src/main/resources/lib/](https://github.com/awslabs/amazon-kinesis-video-streams-producer-sdk-java/tree/master/src/main/resources/lib) for Mac (x64), Ubuntu (x64) and Raspian (x86). If pre-built libraries did not work for you, ["KinesisVideoProducerJNI"](https://github.com/awslabs/amazon-kinesis-video-streams-producer-sdk-cpp) native library needs to be built first before running the Java demo application. Please follow the steps  in the section **Build the native library (KinesisVideoProducerJNI) to run Java Demo App** in Producer SDK CPP [readme](https://github.com/awslabs/amazon-kinesis-video-streams-producer-sdk-cpp).

### Building from Source

Import the Maven project to your IDE, it will find dependency packages from Maven and build.

### Examples

#### Launching Demoapp sample application

Run `DemoAppMain.java` in `./src/main/demo` with JVM arguments set to
```
-Daws.accessKeyId={YourAwsAccessKey} -Daws.secretKey={YourAwsSecretKey} -Djava.library.path={NativeLibraryPath} 
```
for **non-temporary** AWS credential.

```
-Daws.accessKeyId={YourAwsAccessKey} -Daws.secretKey={YourAwsSecretKey} -Daws.sessionToken={YourAwsSessionToken} -Djava.library.path={NativeLibraryPath}
```
for *temporary* AWS credential.

**Note**: NativeLibraryPath must contain your ["KinesisVideoProducerJNI"](https://github.com/awslabs/amazon-kinesis-video-streams-producer-sdk-cpp#build-the-native-library-kinesisvideoproducerjni-to-run-java-demo-app) library. File name depends on your Operating System:
* `libKinesisVideoProducerJNI.so` for Linux 
* `libKinesisVideoProducerJNI.dylib` for Mac OS 
* `KinesisVideoProducerJNI.dll` for Windows

If you are using pre-built libraries, please specify the path of library. Take pre-build library for Mac as example, you can specify `src/resources/lib/mac` as {NativeLibraryPath}.

Demo app will start running and putting sample video frames in a loop into Kinesis Video Streams. You can change your stream settings in `DemoAppMain.java` before you run the app.

##### Run the demo application from command line 

If you want to run the `DemoAppMain`, follow the [steps](https://github.com/awslabs/amazon-kinesis-video-streams-producer-sdk-java/issues/14) below.

Change the current working directory to

```
$ cd /<YOUR_FOLDER_PATH_WHERE_SDK_IS_DOWNLOADED>/amazon-kinesis-video-streams-producer-sdk-java/
```

Compile the Java SDK and Demoapp 
``` 
$ mvn package
```
Create a temporary filename in /tmp directory
```
$ jar_files=$(mktemp)
```
Create classpath string of dependencies from the local repository to a file

```
$ mvn -Dmdep.outputFile=$jar_files dependency:build-classpath
```
Set the **LD_LIBRARY_PATH** to include the open source dependencies.

(refer: [Kinesis Video Streams Producer SDK CPP](https://github.com/awslabs/amazon-kinesis-video-streams-producer-sdk-cpp)
```
$ export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/<YOUR_FOLDER_PATH_WHERE_SDK_IS_DOWNLOADED>/amazon-kinesis-video-streams-producer-sdk-cpp/kinesis-video-native-build/downloads/local/lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH
$ classpath_values=$(cat $jar_files)
```
Start the demo app
```
$ java -classpath target/kinesisvideo-java-demo-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar:$classpath_values -Daws.accessKeyId=${ACCESS_KEY} -Daws.secretKey=${SECRET_KEY} -Djava.library.path=/opt/amazon-kinesis-video-streams-producer-sdk-cpp/kinesis-video-native-build com.amazonaws.kinesisvideo.demoapp.DemoAppMain

```

##### Run the demo application from Docker

Refer the **README.md** file in the  *dockerscripts* folder for running the build and demo app within Docker container.

#### Launching PutMediaDemo sample application

 Run `PutMediaDemo.java` to send sample mkv stream to Kinesis Video Streams. **Note:** ACCESS_KEY and SECRET_KEY are required for running this sample application as well. However, this demo application does not require JNI. 

```
-Daws.accessKeyId={YourAwsAccessKey} -Daws.secretKey={YourAwsSecretKey} 
```
for **non-temporary** AWS credential.

```
-Daws.accessKeyId={YourAwsAccessKey} -Daws.secretKey={YourAwsSecretKey} -Daws.sessionToken={YourAwsSessionToken}
```
#### Pre-built KinesisVideoProducerJNI library supported platforms
* Mac OS X (El capitan 10.11 or above)
* Ubuntu (14.04 or above)
* Raspian (9 stretch or above)

#### Additional Examples

For additional examples on using Kinesis Video Streams Java SDK and  Kinesis Video Streams Parsing Library refer: 

##### [Kinesis Video Streams Producer SDK CPP](https://github.com/awslabs/amazon-kinesis-video-streams-producer-sdk-cpp/blob/master/README.md)
##### [Kinesis Video Streams Parser Library](https://github.com/aws/amazon-kinesis-video-streams-parser-library/blob/master/README.md)

##### [Kinesis Video Streams Android](https://github.com/awslabs/aws-sdk-android-samples/tree/master/AmazonKinesisVideoDemoApp)

#### Troubleshooting

If you notice error in loading the native library (JNI), then check the output of `ldd` or `otool`

```
$ ldd libKinesisVideoProducerJNI.so
```
or in MacOS
```
$ otool -L libKinesisVideoProducerJNI.dylib
```

This will provide details on missing libraries during linking; If the output shows missing shared libraries, then run the following commands to clean the `CMakeCache` and link again.  

```
rm -rf ./kinesis-video-native-build/CMakeCache.txt ./kinesis-video-native-build/CMakeFiles
 
```
and run `./install-script` again.

```
./install-script

```
Also, set the `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` as below
```
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/<YOUR_PRODUCER_SDK_CPP_DOWNLOAD>/amazon-kinesis-video-streams-producer-sdk-cpp/kinesis-video-native-build/downloads/local/lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH
```

This should resolve native library loading issues.
