## Introduction

Amazon Kinesis Video Streams makes it easy to securely stream video from connected devices to AWS for analytics, machine learning (ML), and other processing.

The Amazon Kinesis Video Streams Producer SDK Java makes it easy to build an on-device application that securely connects to a video stream, and reliably publishes video and other media data to Kinesis Video Streams. It takes care of all the underlying tasks required to package the frames and fragments generated by the device's media pipeline. The SDK also handles stream creation, token rotation for secure and uninterrupted streaming, processing acknowledgements returned by Kinesis Video Streams, and other tasks.

### Building from Source

Import the Maven project to your IDE, it will find dependency packages from Maven and build.

### Launching sample application
Run DemoAppMain.java in ./src/main/demo with JVM arguments set to
* "-Daws.accessKeyId={YourAwsAccessKey} -Daws.secretKey={YourAwsSecretKey} -Djava.library.path={NativeLibraryPath}" for non-temporary AWS credential.
* "-Daws.accessKeyId={YourAwsAccessKey} -Daws.secretKey={YourAwsSecretKey} -Daws.sessionToken={YourAwsSessionToken} -Djava.library.path={NativeLibraryPath}" for temporary AWS credential.

*Note: NativeLibraryPath must contain  your ["KinesisVideoProducerJNI"](https://github.com/awslabs/amazon-kinesis-video-streams-producer-sdk-cpp) library. (File name depends on your Operating System, "libKinesisVideoProducerJNI.so" for Linux, "libKinesisVideoProducerJNI.dylib" for Mac OS, "KinesisVideoProducerJNI.dll" for Windows)*

Demo app will start running and putting sample video frames in a loop into Kinesis Video Streams. You can change your stream settings in DemoAppMain.java before you run the app.

## Release Notes

### Release 1.1.0 (December 2017)

* Updated JNI code to expose ACKs as callbacks so developer can get more information about how the streaming is going.
* The version of JNI is bumped to 1.2, this will require corresponding ["KinesisVideoProducerJNI"](https://github.com/awslabs/amazon-kinesis-video-streams-producer-sdk-cpp) with same version.

### Release 1.0.0 (November 2017)

* First release of the Amazon Kinesis Video Producer SDK Java.
